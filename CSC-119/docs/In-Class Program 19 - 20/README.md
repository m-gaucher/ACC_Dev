## In Class Program 19 
### Introduction
In this program, we will use a Text editor to formally write our program. The final solution MUST run successfully as a Python program. This program will demonstrate what we have learned from Chapter 9. We intend to demonstrate competencies in the following topics:

* **Dictionary declaration**
* **Dictionary access**
* **Alternative dictionary keys of mutable type**

Our goal is to understand the fundamental concepts of the dictionary data
structure. Additionally, we hope to contrast the difference between indexed
(e.g. list, tuples, string) and associative data structures.

### Procedure
1. Declare/Create a dictionary of values
2. Print elements by key value
3. Print entire dictionary
4. Update item in dictionary
5. Add item to dictionary
6. Delete item from dictionary
7. Remove all items in a dictionary
8. Delete dictionary
9. Print length of dictionaries
10. Print dictionaries as strings
11. Print dictionary by keys and values
12. Determine if a dictionary has a given key

## In Class Program 20
### Introduction
InIn this program, we will use a Text editor to formally write our program.
The final solution MUST run successfully as a Python program. This program will demonstrate what we have learned from Chapter 9. We intend to demonstrate competencies in the following topics: this program, we will use a Text editor to formally write our program. The final solution MUST run successfully as a Python program. This program will demonstrate what we have learned from Chapter 8. We intend to demonstrate competencies in the following topics:

* **Sets**
* **Set membership**
* **Set operations**

Our goal is to demonstrate the implementations and operations of Sets. This will provide a data structure for mathematical set operations.

### Procedure
1. Declare a Set
2. Set membership
3. Add item to set
4. Remove item from set
5. Union
6. Intersection
7. Difference
8. Symmetric difference
9. Size
