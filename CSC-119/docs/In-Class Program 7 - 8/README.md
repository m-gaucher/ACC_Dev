# In Class Programs 7 & 8
_Prepared for: CSC-119 Students_ /

**Due: Date at 11:59 PM MT**

## In Class Program 7 
### Introduction
In this program, we will continue using a Text editor to formally write our program. You can still use the interpreter to sanity check your arithmetic, but the final solution MUST run successfully as a Python program. This program will summarize what we have learned from Chapter 3. We intend to demonstrate competencies in the following topics:

* **Boolean Expressions**
* **Selection Control**
* **Iterative Control**
* **While Statement**
* **Infinite Loops**

Our goal is to convert between Decimal and Binary numbers, entered by a user. We will make use of loops to simplify our implementation.

> :turtle: **_Before continuing please install Turtle from [here](http://pythonturtle.org/)_** 

### Procedure
1. Prompt the user for a whole number.
2. Convert the whole number to binary
3. Print the whole number converted to binary

> :page_facing_up: [Inc7prog.py]
```python
@TODO -add code from other src file
      -show implementation using function
      -create recursive func for chap 10

#using built-ins; algorithms in src folder
print ("using built-in format() binary: ",format(sanity_num, 'b'))
print ("using built-in bin(): ",bin(sanity_num))
print ("using built-in bin() and list slice: ",bin(sanity_num)[2:], "\n\n")

```

1. Prompt the user for a binary number
2. Convert the binary number to a whole number
3. Print the whole number converted from the binary number

```python
#@TODO -add code from source
#      -create function for demo purposes
#      -create recusive func for chap 10 demo

#using built-in; alogrithms in src folder
print ("Sanity check: ", int(num, 2))
