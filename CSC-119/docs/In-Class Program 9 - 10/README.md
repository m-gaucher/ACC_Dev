## In Class 
### Introduction
In  this  program,  we  will  use  a  Text  editor  to  formally  write  our  program.The  nal solution MUST run successfully as a Python program.  This pro-gram will demonstrate what we have learned from Chapter 4.  We intend todemonstrate competencies in the following topics:
* Lists
```python
num_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
```
* For Loops
```python
word = "bird"
for letter in word:
  print(letter)
```
* Range function
```python
for num in range(6):
    print(num)
```
* List Operations
```python
#delcare empty list
item_list = []

#add item(s) to list
item_list.append(1)
item_list.append("Me")

#update item(s) in list
item_list[0] = 111
item_list[1] = "MeToo"

#delete entire list
del item_list
```

Our goal is to iterate forward and backward in a list.  This is to get usfamiliar  with  the  basic   ow  of  underlying  functions  provided  by  lists.   Wewill then use some of these list operations to manipulate our given list.
