## In Class 9 
### Introduction
In this program, we will use a Text editor to formally write our program. The final solution MUST run successfully as a Python program.  This program will demonstrate what we have learned from Chapter 4.  We intend to demonstrate competencies in the following topics:

* **Lists**
```python
num_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
```
* **For Loops**
```python
word = "bird"
for letter in word:
  print(letter)
```
* **Range function**
```python
for num in range(6):
    print(num)
```
* **List Operations**
```python
#delcare empty list
item_list = []

#add item(s) to list
item_list.append(1)
item_list.append("Me")

#update item(s) in list
item_list[0] = 111
item_list[1] = "MeToo"

#delete entire list
del item_list
```

Our goal is to iterate forward and backward in a list.  This is to get us familiar with the basic floow of underlying functions  provided by lists.  We will then use some of these list operations to manipulate our given list.

### Procedure
1. Declare/Create a list of numbers
2. Iterate forward through the list
3. Iterate backwards through the list
4. Append an item into the list
5. Retrieve a value in a list
6. Update a value in a list
7. Insert a value in a list
8. Remove a value in a list
9. Delete a list
