## Part 2: Programming Exercises
### Introduction
For this part of the homework, we will create a pulse wave with ASCII characters
based on the Unicode values, of each character, in your rst name.

### Procedure

1. Prompt the user for their rst name (this is simply used for display purposes; nothing more)
2. Print the rst name variable
3. Prompt the user for a pulse number (this will be used later in you algorithm)
4. Print the pulse number variable
5. Print the Unicode values of each character in their rst name
6. Print the sum of Unicode characters of the rst name
7. Print the dierence of Unicode characters in the rst name
8. Print each character of the rst name, per line, followed by a series ASCII characters
Series = ( Unicode value % pulse number variable )

## Hints

1. To make a pulse, use the mod(%) operator.
2. Prompt is used to indicate the system is awaiting user input, to ultimately store in a variable.
3. We can convert an int to a string via str() and we can convert a base10 string to an int via int()
