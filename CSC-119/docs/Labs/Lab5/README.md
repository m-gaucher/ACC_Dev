## Part 2: Functions
### Introduction
Recall from In Class Program 11 & 12, we used a couple forms of functions to achieve desired results for a given routine.


### Procedure

1. Prompt the user to enter the first integer
2. Prompt the user to enter the second integer
3. Write a function to determine a given number is even
4. Write a function to determine a given number is odd
5. Write a function to determine if the first integer is greater than the second integer
6. Write a function to determine if the first integer is less than the second integer
7. Write a function to determine the least common multiple of the two integers
8. Write a function to determine if a given integer is prime
9. Write a function to determine if a given integer is composite (e.g. not prime)
10. Call the even function on the first and second integer (output the results)
11. Call the odd function on the first and second integer (output the results)
12. Call the greater than function on the first and second integer (output the results)
13. Call the less than function on the first and second integer (output the results)
14. Call the least common multiple function on the first and second integer (output the results)
15. Call the prime function on the first and second integer (output the results)
16. Call the composite function on the first and second integer (output the results)

**Prime:** a positive integer that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. More concisely, a prime number is a positive integer having exactly one positive divisor other than 1, meaning it is a number that cannot be factored. (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23...etc)

**Least Common Multiple:** The smallest positive number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. (e.g 3 & 5 would have 15 as the least common multiple)

```python

'''
print first n primes

*note: change format padding per prime for large n
'''
def print_primes(n):
    count = 2
    prime = 5
    factor = 3
    
    if(n == 1):
        print("The first prime number is 2.")
    else:
        print("The first", n ,"prime numbers are:\n")
        print('{var:<4}'.format(var = 2),'{var:<5}'.format(var = 3),end='')
    
    while (count < n):
        last_factor = int((prime**(1/2)))
        
        for factor in range(3, last_factor, 2):
            if( prime % factor == 0):
                break
        
        if(prime % factor != 0):
            count+=1
            print('{var:<5}'.format(var=prime),end='')
            
            #print 10 primes per line
            if(count % 10 == 0):
                print()
        prime += 2

print_primes(100)  

```

```
The first 100 prime numbers are:

2    3    5    7    11   13   17   19   23   25    
29   31   35   37   41   43   47   49   53   59    
61   67   71   73   79   83   89   97   101  103   
107  109  113  121  127  131  137  139  143  149   
151  157  163  167  169  173  179  181  191  193   
197  199  211  223  227  229  233  239  241  251

361  367  373  379  383  389  397  401  409  419   
421  431  433  439  443  449  457  461  463  467
