## Part 2: Modules / Program 1 Continued
### Introduction
Recall from In Class Program 15, we learned about the time module. We will use the sleep method to
allow us to debug our Turtle iterations. Additionally, continue to work on implementing features of
Program 1.

### Procedure
1. Write a function to walk the turtle along a path of points

  ⋅⋅⋅Print each x and y points per iteration⋅⋅
  
  ⋅⋅⋅Call the sleep function to pause the Turtle as it travels along the path⋅⋅
  
2. Write a function to print the duration of time the Turtle was traveling along the above path
3. Write a function to print when the Turtle has reached the last point of the above path
4. Write a function to create a single point obstacle in your maze
5. Write a function to create a wall/boundary around the entire window size (e.g. width, height)

  ⋅⋅⋅Mark this in your maze representation (e.g ```maze[xpoint][ypoint] = 5``` )⋅⋅
  
  ⋅⋅⋅Mark this same point visually in your turtle window⋅⋅
