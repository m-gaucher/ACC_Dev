## Part 2: Text Files / Program 1 Continued
### Introduction
Recall from In Class Program 18, we learned how to write data to a file. We will use a similar approach to output our Turtle maze for Program 1.

### Procedure
1. Create a 2-d maze that is 10x10 
2. Mark a location(x,y point within maze) with a start value
3. Mark a location(x,y point within maze) with a obstacle/wall value
4. Mark a location(x,y point within maze) with an end value
5. Open a file to output maze data
6. Output the maze data each row at a time
7. Close the file
