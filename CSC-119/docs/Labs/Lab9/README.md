## Part 2: Text Files / Program 1 Continued
### Introduction
Create a program to maintain a dictionary of usernames and their asso-
ciated names. For this program you need to determine what goes in blank,
and ensure the program operates gracefully.

```python

# Define original dictionary
usernames = {'John ': 'john - bird ', 'Jenna ': 'redcar5 '}

while True :
   # Request user to enter a name
   print ('Enter a name :')

   # Assign a var for name
   name = input ()

   # Check if name is in dictionary
   #if <blank > in <blank >:
   #  print ( usernames [ name ] + ' is username of ' + name )
   #else :
   #not found
   # print (" Item : " + name + " not found in username dicitonary ")
   # get a new username for above name
   # uname = input ()

   # assign new item to dictionary
   # usernames [ name ] = <blank >
   # print (" Added item :" + uname )

```
