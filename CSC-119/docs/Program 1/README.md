# Turtle Program

Below is the demo code from class with a few modifications.

_Note: resolved specific IDE window issue causing instant window close after window.listen()_

```python

# create variables to store statistics of the turtle path
start_time = 0
end_time = 0
distance = 0

# create a "legend" for values in the map
START_LOC = 1
END_LOC = 2
OBST_LOC = 3

# create vars to width and height of map
MAP_WIDTH = 250
MAP_HEIGHT = 250
TURN_DEGREE = 90

# create the maze for underlying map logic
# (e.g. start location, obstacle location, end location)
maze = [[0] * MAP_WIDTH for i in range(MAP_HEIGHT)]
